FSCode is a light-weight, HTML-like markup language that was originally designed for use in websites with many different modules such as forums, wikis, and user-mail systems.

It is an XML-syntax, however it makes use of a limited subset of special macros and formatting that allows is to be used more safely in environments like public websites and forums.

It could also be easily modified to emit any other kind of output, such as RTF, TeX, ODF, etc.

As this is an XML-style markup language it does need to be wrapped in a root tag, <code>&lt;fscode&gt;&lt;/fscode&gt;</code>.  You may wish to do this automatically for your users.
